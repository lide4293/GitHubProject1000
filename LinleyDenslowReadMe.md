### About Me 
- Hello, my name is Linley Denslow!
- I am a Freshman at CU Boulder studying Computer Science. 
- I am learning how to use GitHub in my Comp Sci 1000 class.
- I am also in Comp Sci 1300, and we are about to start working on our final project: to create a program that acts like the board game Game of Life (but Lion King themed!)
